#IBM Internship Project  

## Reactive-streams-with-java-11-and-mongoDB-trigger.

Generated dashboard APIs for students using reactive streams along with trigger functionality.  

The students can be filtered based on their department. 
For trigger functionality, tailable cursor is implemented due to which on addition of any new entry in the database, it is reflected in real time.  

## Technologies used : 

Spring boot (java 11), mongoDB, maven, swagger2 for API documentation.
